This is an agriculture based web application. It is an e-commerce platform that seeks to link farmers and buyers. Farmers can list their products for sale on the marketplace and buyers can place bids on different products. These bids can either be accepted or rejected by the farmer. If a bid is accepted the buyer can place an order and make a transaction. The nearest driver is assigned the delivery by the system and the product is delivered to the customer.
